      "**4. weirdo | oddball's**\n",

      "* **Degree of Connection:** 4\n",
      "* **Explanation:** This connection is strong. \"Weirdo\" and \"oddball\" are synonyms, both referring to someone who is strange or unconventional. The possessive \"oddball's\" further strengthens the connection by suggesting that the \"weirdo\" belongs to the category of \"oddballs.\"\n",
